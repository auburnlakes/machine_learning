# machine_learning
notebooks and algos to machine learning fundamentals
Most of the work here is in python and covers:
1. Problem solving
2. estimating probability distributions
3. learning with linear classifiers
4. decision trees and model selection
5. debugging and improving ML models
6. learning with kernel machines
7. deep learning and neural networks
8. linear algebra: high dimension
